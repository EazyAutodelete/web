		<h2>3. General information and mandatory information</h2>

		<!--- ___ ___ ___-->
		<h3>Data protection</h3>
		<p>
			We take the protection of your personal data very seriously. Hence, we handle your personal data as confidential
			information and in compliance with the statutory data protection regulations and this Data Protection Declaration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whenever you use our services, a variety of personal information will be collected. Personal data comprises data
			that can be used to personally identify you. This Data Protection Declaration explains which data we collect as
			well as the purposes we use this data for. It also explains how, and for which purpose the information is
			collected.
		</p>
		<p>
			We herewith advise you that the transmission of data via the Internet (i.e., through e-mail communications) may be
			prone to security gaps. It is not possible to completely protect data against third-party access.
		</p>
		<h3>Information about the responsible party (referred to as the &ldquo;controller&rdquo; in the GDPR)</h3>
		<p>The data processing controller on this service is:</p>
		<p>
			Ben Schiemann<br />
			Reinbeker Weg 70<br />
			21465 Wentorf
		</p>

		<p>
			Phone: +49 1516 4877269<br />
			E-mail: info@qreepex.xyz
		</p>
		<p>
			The controller is the natural person or legal entity that single-handedly or jointly with others makes decisions
			as to the purposes of and resources for the processing of personal data (e.g., names, e-mail addresses, etc.).
		</p>

		<h3>Storage duration</h3>
		<p>
			Unless a more specific storage period has been specified in this privacy policy, your personal data will remain
			with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified request for
			deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we have other legally
			permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter
			case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
		</p>
		<h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing within our services</h3>
		<p>
			If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art.
			9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO. In the case of explicit
			consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing is also based on Art. 49 (1)(a)
			GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access to information in your end device (e.g.,
			via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally based on &sect; 25 (1) TDDDG. The consent can be
			revoked at any time. If your data is required for the fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of
			pre-contractual measures, we process your data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is
			required for the fulfillment of a legal obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore,
			the data processing may be carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
			Information on the relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this
			privacy policy.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Information on the data transfer to third-party countries that are not secure under data protection law and the
			transfer to US companies that are not DPF-certified
		</h3>
		<p>
			We use, among other technologies, tools from companies located in third-party countries that are not safe under
			data protection law, as well as US tools whose providers are not certified under the EU-US Data Privacy Framework
			(DPF). If these tools are enabled, your personal data may be transferred to and processed in these countries. We
			would like you to note that no level of data protection comparable to that in the EU can be guaranteed in third
			countries that are insecure in terms of data protection law.
		</p>
		<p>
			We would like to point out that the US, as a secure third-party country, generally has a level of data protection
			comparable to that of the EU. Data transfer to the US is therefore permitted if the recipient is certified under
			the &ldquo;EU-US Data Privacy Framework&rdquo; (DPF) or has appropriate additional assurances. Information on
			transfers to third-party countries, including the data recipients, can be found in this Privacy Policy.
		</p>
		<h3>Recipients of personal data</h3>
		<p>
			In the scope of our business activities, we cooperate with various external parties. In some cases, this also
			requires the transfer of personal data to these external parties. We only disclose personal data to external
			parties if this is required as part of the fulfillment of a contract, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g.,
			disclosure of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in the disclosure pursuant to Art. 6
			(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits the disclosure of this data. When using processors, we only
			disclose personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid contract on data processing. In the case of joint
			processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.
		</p>
		<h3>Revocation of your consent to the processing of data</h3>
		<p>
			A wide range of data processing transactions are possible only subject to your express consent. You can also
			revoke at any time any consent you have already given us. This shall be without prejudice to the lawfulness of any
			data collection that occurred prior to your revocation.
		</p>
		<h3>
			Right to object to the collection of data in special cases; right to object to direct advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)
		</h3>
		<p>
			IN THE EVENT THAT DATA ARE PROCESSED ON THE BASIS OF ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO AT ANY TIME
			OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA BASED ON GROUNDS ARISING FROM YOUR UNIQUE SITUATION. THIS ALSO
			APPLIES TO ANY PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. TO DETERMINE THE LEGAL BASIS, ON WHICH ANY PROCESSING OF DATA
			IS BASED, PLEASE CONSULT THIS DATA PROTECTION DECLARATION. IF YOU LOG AN OBJECTION, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR
			AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA, UNLESS WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PRESENT COMPELLING PROTECTION WORTHY GROUNDS FOR THE
			PROCESSING OF YOUR DATA, THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS OR IF THE PURPOSE OF THE PROCESSING IS
			THE CLAIMING, EXERCISING OR DEFENCE OF LEGAL ENTITLEMENTS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).
		</p>
		<p>
			IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS BEING PROCESSED IN ORDER TO ENGAGE IN DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO
			THE PROCESSING OF YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSES OF SUCH ADVERTISING AT ANY TIME. THIS ALSO APPLIES
			TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS AFFILIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA
			WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT ADVERTISING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).
		</p>
		<h3>Right to log a complaint with the competent supervisory agency</h3>
		<p>
			In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects are entitled to log a complaint with a supervisory agency,
			in particular in the member state where they usually maintain their domicile, place of work or at the place where
			the alleged violation occurred. The right to log a complaint is in effect regardless of any other administrative
			or court proceedings available as legal recourses.
		</p>
		<h3>Right to data portability</h3>
		<p>
			You have the right to have data that we process automatically on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a
			contract handed over to you or to a third party in a common, machine-readable format. If you should demand the
			direct transfer of the data to another controller, this will be done only if it is technically feasible.
		</p>
		<h3>Information about, rectification and eradication of data</h3>
		<p>
			Within the scope of the applicable statutory provisions, you have the right to demand information about your
			archived personal data, their source and recipients as well as the purpose of the processing of your data at any
			time. You may also have a right to have your data rectified or eradicated. If you have questions about this
			subject matter or any other questions about personal data, please do not hesitate to contact us at any time.
		</p>
		<h3>Right to demand processing restrictions</h3>
		<p>
			You have the right to demand the imposition of restrictions as far as the processing of your personal data is
			concerned. To do so, you may contact us at any time. The right to demand restriction of processing applies in the
			following cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				In the event that you should dispute the correctness of your data archived by us, we will usually need some time
				to verify this claim. During the time that this investigation is ongoing, you have the right to demand that we
				restrict the processing of your personal data.
			</li>
			<li>
				If the processing of your personal data was/is conducted in an unlawful manner, you have the option to demand
				the restriction of the processing of your data instead of demanding the eradication of this data.
			</li>
			<li>
				If we do not need your personal data any longer and you need it to exercise, defend or claim legal entitlements,
				you have the right to demand the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of its eradication.
			</li>
			<li>
				If you have raised an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, your rights and our rights will have to be weighed
				against each other. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to demand
				a restriction of the processing of your personal data.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data &ndash; with the exception of their
			archiving &ndash; may be processed only subject to your consent or to claim, exercise or defend legal entitlements
			or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities or for important public interest reasons cited
			by the European Union or a member state of the EU.
		</p>
		<h3>SSL and/or TLS encryption</h3>
		<p>
			For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as purchase orders or inquiries
			you submit to us, our services uses either an SSL or a TLS encryption program. You can recognize an encrypted
			connection by checking whether the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to
			&ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
		</p>
		<p>If the SSL or TLS encryption is activated, data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>
		<h3>Encrypted payment transactions</h3>
		<p>
			If you are under an obligation to share your payment information (e.g. account number if you give us the authority
			to debit your bank account) with us after you have entered into a fee-based contract with us, this information is
			required to process payments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Payment transactions using common modes of paying (Visa/MasterCard, debit to your bank account) are processed
			exclusively via encrypted SSL or TLS connections. You can recognize an encrypted connection by checking whether
			the address line of the browser switches from &ldquo;http://&rdquo; to &ldquo;https://&rdquo; and also by the
			appearance of the lock icon in the browser line.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the communication with us is encrypted, third parties will not be able to read the payment information you
			share with us.
		</p>
		<h2>4. Recording of data</h2>
		<h3>Discord</h3>
		<p>We collect data of Discord via its API and Gateway.</p>
		<p>
			The service has the ability to read every message and its attachments in the channels it has access to through the
			Discord API and Gateway. The service will only read the content of messages and attachments if it is setup to work
			in that specific channel.
		</p>
		<p>
			The content of message and attachments is read and processed to provide core features of the service. Once the
			content has been processed once without being written to a disk, it is not read or saved. After that, we can not
			and do not intend to access this content.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other information about every message in your server can be stored, written on disk and re-processed at any time.
			Those information include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>IDs of the message, the webhook, the author, the channel and guild it was sent in;</li>
			<li>timestamps of when the message was sent and last edited;</li>
			<li>flags, type, mentions of the message and whether it is pinned;</li>
			<li>amout of attachments, reactions, emojis, stickersand embeds in the message;</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The Bot may store data other than messages, including but not limited to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>name, ID, invite, features, date of joining, owner-ID and icon of your server;</li>
			<li>IDs, roles, preffered locale, username, avatar and permissions of all members within your server;</li>
			<li>IDs, names, permissions and positions of all roles within your server;</li>
			<li>
				name, ID, meta-data, type, position, flag and last message ids of all channels and threads within your server.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>

		<p>
			Our services use what the industry refers to as &ldquo;cookies.&rdquo; Cookies are small data packages that do not
			cause any damage to your device. They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session

			them, or they are automatically eradicated by your web browser.
		</p>
		<p>
			Cookies can be issued by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies).
			Third-party cookies enable the integration of certain services of third-party companies into websites (e.g.,

		</p>
		<p>
			Cookies have a variety of functions. Many cookies are technically essential since certain functions of our
			services would not work in the absence of these cookies (e.g., the shopping cart function or the display of
			videos). Other cookies may be used to analyze user behavior or for promotional purposes.
		</p>

		<h2>7. Data processing through social networks</h2>
		<p>
			We maintain publicly available profiles in social networks. The individual social networks we use can be found
			below.
		</p>
		<p>
			Social networks such as Facebook, X etc. can generally analyze your user behavior comprehensively if you visit
			their website or a website with integrated social media content (e.g., like buttons or banner ads). When you visit
			our social media pages, numerous data protection-relevant processing operations are triggered. In detail:
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are logged in to your social media account and visit our social media page, the operator of the social
			media portal can assign this visit to your user account. Under certain circumstances, your personal data may also
			be recorded if you are not logged in or do not have an account with the respective social media portal. In this
			case, this data is collected, for example, via cookies stored on your device or by recording your IP address.
		</p>
		<p>
			Using the data collected in this way, the operators of the social media portals can create user profiles in which
			their preferences and interests are stored. This way you can see interest-based advertising inside and outside of
			your social media presence. If you have an account with the social network, interest-based advertising can be
			displayed on any device you are logged in to or have logged in to.
		</p>
		<p>
			Please also note that we cannot retrace all processing operations on the social media portals. Depending on the
			provider, additional processing operations may therefore be carried out by the operators of the social media
			portals. Details can be found in the terms of use and privacy policy of the respective social media portals.
		</p>
		<h4>Legal basis</h4>
		<p>
			Our social media appearances should ensure the widest possible presence on the Internet. This is a legitimate
			interest within the meaning of Art. 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. The analysis processes initiated by the social networks may
			be based on divergent legal bases to be specified by the operators of the social networks (e.g., consent within
			the meaning of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR).
		</p>
		<h4>Responsibility and assertion of rights</h4>
		<p>
			If you visit one of our social media sites (e.g., Facebook), we, together with the operator of the social media
			platform, are responsible for the data processing operations triggered during this visit. You can in principle
			protect your rights (information, correction, deletion, limitation of processing, data portability and complaint)
			vis-&agrave;-vis us as well as vis-&agrave;-vis the operator of the respective social media portal (e.g.,
			Facebook).
		</p>
		<p>
			Please note that despite the shared responsibility with the social media portal operators, we do not have full
			influence on the data processing operations of the social media portals. Our options are determined by the company
			policy of the respective provider.
		</p>
		<h4>Storage time</h4>
		<p>
			The data collected directly from us via the social media presence will be deleted from our systems as soon as you
			ask us to delete it, you revoke your consent to the storage or the purpose for the data storage lapses. Stored
			cookies remain on your device until you delete them. Mandatory statutory provisions - in particular, retention
			periods - remain unaffected.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have no control over the storage duration of your data that are stored by the social network operators for
			their own purposes. For details, please contact the social network operators directly (e.g., in their privacy
			policy, see below).
		</p>
		<h4>Your rights</h4>
		<p>
			You have the right to receive information about the origin, recipient and purpose of your stored personal data at
			any time and free of charge. You also have the right to object, the right to data portability and the right to
			file a complaint with the responsible regulatory agency. Furthermore, you can request the correction, blocking,
			deletion and, under certain circumstances, the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
