				<i
					>— I/We (*) hereby give notice that I/We (*) withdraw from my/our (*) contract of sale of the following goods

			<h2>Effects of withdrawal</h2>
			<p>
				If you withdraw from your subscription, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, without undue
				delay and in any event not later than fourteen days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to
				withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used
				for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any
				fees as a result of such reimbursement.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you requested to begin the performance of services during the withdrawal period, you shall pay us an amount
				which is in proportion to what has been provided until you have communicated us your withdrawal from this
				contract, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.
			</p>
