        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>
          We do not share any of your personal or Discord server data with third-party services. We may use your
          information to improve our services, with and without personally identifying you.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may log all messages posted on your server to provide our service while only storing message content and
          attachments temporary.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Information we Collect</h3>
        <p>
          Information we collect includes both information you knowingly and actively provide us when using or
          participating in any of our services and promotions, and any information automatically sent by your devices in
          the course of accessing our products and services.
        </p>

        <h4>Log Data</h4>
        <p>
          When you visit our website, our servers may automatically log the standard data provided by your web browser.
          It may include your device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, the pages you
          visit, the time and date of your visit, other details about your visit, and technical details that occur in
          conjunction with any errors you may encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to
          combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.
        </p>

        <h4>Collection and Use of Information</h4>
        <p>We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following on our website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use a mobile device or web browser to access our content</li>
          <li>Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We may log all messages posted on your server. We only do this to provide our services. These logged messages
          are securely stored in our database without any intern or publicly available endpoint, making it impossible
          for anyone to get messages without direct database access. We will not share any logged messages with
          third-party services.
        </p>
        <p>If not said otherwise, we may not automatically delete collected/stored log data.</p>

        <h4>Security of Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it
          within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized (third-party) access,
          disclosure, copying, use, or modification.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although we do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, please note that no method of
          electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure and no one can guarantee absolute data security. We will
          comply with the laws applicable to us with respect to any data breach.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for the choice of password and its overall security strength to ensure the security of
          your own data within our services.
        </p>

        <h4>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h4>
        <p>
          We keep your personal information (Discord Authentication Token) for 7 days. A request for deletion of log
          data can be made at any time, otherwise log data will not be deleted.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can have your personal information and server database deleted at any time by contacting our support team
          via Discord.
