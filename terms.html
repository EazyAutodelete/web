            <h2>User Content</h2>

            <p>
              <strong>User Content.</strong> "User Content" means all information and content that a User submits on the

              your User Content. You hereby certify that Your User Content does not violate our Acceptable Use Policy.
              You must not create the impression to others that your User Content is in any way provided, sponsored or

              User Content may be deleted at any time without prior notice. You are solely responsible for creating your
              own backup copies of your User Content, if you so choose.
            </p>

            <p>
              You hereby grant to the Operator an irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide
              license to reproduce, distribute, publicly display and perform, prepare derivative works of, incorporate
              into other works, and otherwise use and exploit Your User Content, and to grant sublicenses of the
              foregoing rights, solely for the purpose of including Your User Content on the Service. You hereby
              irrevocably waive any claims or assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to Your User
              Content.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Acceptable Use Policy.</strong> The following terms constitute our "Acceptable Use Policy": You
              agree not to use the Service to collect, upload, transmit, display, or distribute any User Content (i)
              that violates any third-party right or any intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) that is
              unlawful, harassing, abusive, tortious, threatening, harmful, invasive of another’s privacy, vulgar,
              defamatory, false, intentionally misleading, trade libelous, pornographic, obscene, patently offensive,
              promotes racism, bigotry, hatred, or physical harm of any kind against any group or individual; (iii) that
              is harmful to minors in any way; or (iv) that is in violation of any law, regulation, or obligations or
              restrictions imposed by any third party.
            </p>

            <p>

              advertising, promotional materials, junk mail, spam, chain letters, pyramid schemes or any other form of
              duplicative or unsolicited messages through the Service; (iii) use the Service to collect, gather or
              compile information or data about other users without their consent; (iv) interfere with, disrupt or
              unreasonably load servers or networks connected to the Service or violate the rules, policies or
              procedures of such networks; (v) attempt to gain unauthorized access to the Service, whether through
              password mining or otherwise; (vi) harass or interfere with other users' use of the Service; or (vi) use
              software or automated agents or scripts to create multiple accounts for the Service or to generate

            </p>

            <p>
              We reserve the right to review all User Content and, in our sole discretion, investigate and/or take
              appropriate action against you if you violate the Acceptable Use Policy or any other provision of these
              Terms or otherwise cause liability to us or any other person. Such actions may include removing or
              modifying your User Content, terminating your account, and/or reporting you to law enforcement
              authorities.

              If you submit any feedback or suggestions to us regarding the Service, you hereby assign to us all rights
              in such feedback and agree that we have the right to use and fully exploit such feedback and related
              information in any manner it deems appropriate. We will treat any feedback you provide to us as
              non-confidential and non-proprietary.
            </p>

            <p>
              You agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from any claim or demand made by any third party due to or
              arising out of (a) your use of the Service, (b) your violation of these Terms, (c) your violation of any
              applicable law or regulation, or (d) your User Content, including costs and attorneys' fees. We reserve
              the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter for which you are required to
              indemnify us, and you agree to cooperate with us in the defense of any such claim. You agree not to settle
              any matter without our prior written consent. We will use reasonable efforts to notify you of any such
              claim, suit or proceeding as soon as it becomes known.
            </p>

            <h2>Third-Party Links & Ads; Other Users</h2>

            <p>
              <strong>Third-Party Links & Ads.</strong> The Service may contain links to third party services and
              services and/or display advertisements for third parties. Such third party links and advertisements are
              not under our control, and we are not responsible for third party links and advertisements. We provide
              access to these third party links and advertisements only as a convenience to you and do not review,
              approve, monitor, endorse, warrant or make any representations regarding third party links and
              advertisements. You use all Third Party Links and Ads at your own risk and should exercise a reasonable
              degree of caution and discretion in doing so. When you click on a third party link or ad, the terms and
              policies of that third party apply, including the third party's privacy and data collection practices.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Other Users.</strong> Each user of the Service is solely responsible for his or her own User
              Content. Because we have no control over User Content, you acknowledge and agree that we are not
              responsible for User Content, whether provided by you or by others. You agree that we will not be liable
              for any loss or damage resulting from such interactions. If a dispute arises between you and a user of the
              service, we have no obligation to become involved.

              party for any lost profits, lost data, cost of procurement for substitute products, or any indirect,
              consequential, exemplary, incidental, special or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with
              these Terms or your use of or inability to use the Service, even if we have been advised of the
              possibility of such damages. Access to and use of our Services is at your sole discretion and risk, and
              you are solely responsible for any damage to your device, computer system, or loss of data in any form.

              Upon termination of your rights under these Terms, your account and your right to access and use the

              deletion of the User Content associated with your account from our live databases. We will not be liable
              to you in any way for any termination of your rights under these Terms. Even after termination of your
